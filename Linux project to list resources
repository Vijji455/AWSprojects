What is the primary reasons for any organizations to move to cloud ?
for below reasons 
1. managebility
any startup company or organization has have their servers and it will have its own maintanance overhead.
upgradations, server failures, patchig, need to have system mgmt team/admin team  etc 
2. Cost 
cloud provides pay as you use model 

To be cost effective what an org hasto do ?
>tracking resource usage 
I am working for example.com it has 100 developers and I provided to all of these developres to AWS workspace.
to be cost effective i have to monitor if every develper is making use of aws resources accuratly or not.
suppose if a devoper X is created 100 ec2  and EBS volumes but no ec2 instances are using EBS volumes but AWS chanrges for EBS volumes as it is created.
As a devops person its primary responsibility to monitor cost effectiveness bcz it is the primary reason that the org moved to cloud.

ther are multiple ways to do resource tracking not only throughshell script like 
>people use lambda functions 
>python script 

Ex: example.com this org is using 
ec2 instance
s3 
lambda functions 
IAM 
task: everyday at certain time we have to pull the status of these resources and supply to a manager (ideally we send this information to repoting dashboard)
create a file that lists no.of each resources available  

>One can manually run this shell script every day but its not a ideal practice 
>so usually any organization follows  like integrate shell script with crontab so one of the linux process executes the shel script at particular time 

Project implementation
>Create ec2 instance 
>connect to ec2 instace through mobaxterm or putty or iterms 
>change permissions to keypair file that downloaded during ec2 creation
>connect toec2 server through private IP address ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@privateIP
>create new dir and install AWS CLI on to it follow official AWS CLI installtion guide 
>do AWS confugure to connect it with aws account by providing securitycredentials
